# DIAS: Droplet Image Analysis Software 

This code estimates changes in the droplet volume over time using different image frames. This is a proof of concept version. More advanced techniques are under development. There are four examples included to illustrate the use of the algorithm.

The context of this code and its evaluation are described on:
  - Alejandro Martin Cohen, Axel Juan Soto, and James P Fawcett. "Determination of Flow Rates in Capillary Liquid Chromatography Coupled to a Nano Electrospray Source using Droplet Image Analysis Software" Analytical Chemistry ([paper])
  
  
How to use:
python dropletImageProcessing.py ["InputDir"] [filePrefix] [#files] [toleranceContour]
e.g:
```
python dropletImageProcessing.py "./Sample videos/flow_300_c/" "sample-" 47 130
```
